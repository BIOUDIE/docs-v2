# React Native SDK

A collection of 100+ React hooks and React Native UI components for your web3 mobile apps, for any EVM-compatible blockchain.

Connect to user's wallets, interact with smart contracts, sign messages, and utilize common standards such as tokens, NFTs, marketplaces; all with built-in caching, RPC URLs, IPFS gateways, and more.

## Requirements

- Android minSdkVersion = 23
- iOS platform >= 13
- XCode > 14

It is recommended that you use a physical device while testing your app, as the emulator/simulator might not support the desired wallets or may not function properly.

## Getting Started

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template react-native-typescript-starter
```
