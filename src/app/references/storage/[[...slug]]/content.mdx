# thirdweb Storage SDK

Best in class decentralized storage SDK for Browser and Node

<br />

## Installation

Install the latest version of the SDK with either `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash
npm install @thirdweb-dev/storage
```

```bash
yarn add @thirdweb-dev/storage
```

<br />

## Quick Start

Once you have the Thirdweb Storage SDK installed, you can use it to easily upload and download files and other data using decentralized storage systems.

Here's a simple example using the SDK to upload and download a file from IPFS:

```jsx
import { ThirdwebStorage } from "@thirdweb-dev/storage";

// First, instantiate the SDK
const storage = new ThirdwebStorage();

// Now we can upload a file and get the upload URI
const file = readFileSync("path/to/file.jpg");
const uri = await storage.upload(file);

// Finally we can download the file data again
const res = await storage.download(uri);
const data = await res.text();
```

Alternatively, we can use the SDK to upload and download metadata and JSON objects, and we can also upload multiple items at once:

```jsx
// We define metadata for 2 different NFTs
const metadata = [
	{
		name: "NFT #1",
		description: "This is my first NFT",
		image: readFileSync("path/to/file.jpg"),
		properties: {
			coolness: 100,
		},
	},
	{
		name: "NFT #2",
		description: "This is my second NFT",
		image: readFileSync("path/to/file.jpg"),
		properties: {
			coolness: 200,
		},
	},
];

// And now we can upload it all at once to a single directory
const uris = await storage.uploadBatch(metadata);

// And easily retrieve the metadata
const metadata = await storage.downloadJSON(uris);
```
