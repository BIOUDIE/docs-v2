Specify whether to show a "Switch Network" button after the wallet is connected and it is not connected to the [activeChain](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#activechain-recommended) set in [ThirdwebProvider](react/react.thirdwebprovider) to encourage the user to switch to the correct network in their wallet.

[activeChain](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#activechain-recommended) must be explicitly set in [ThirdwebProvider](react/react.thirdwebprovider) for this to work.

default is `false`.

```jsx
<ConnectWallet switchToActiveChain={true} />
```
